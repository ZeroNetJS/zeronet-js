A JS version of ZeroNet, using libp2p.

# About

This project was mainly created to see how the zeronet protocol can be improved and to provide better programmaticall usage of zeronet.

But it will also be compatible with zeronet-py (and will have an uiserver).

# CLI Usage

> TODO...

---

### Todos/Notes have been moved to [the Roadmap](/ROADMAP.md)

# Running

Just run `npm start` and it should:

-   Launch a server on 0.0.0.0:15543
-   Launch a uiserver on 127.0.0.1:15544
-   Make itself visible in the mdns

### This module uses `pull-streams`

We expose a streaming interface based on `pull-streams`, rather then on the Node.js core streams implementation (aka Node.js streams). `pull-streams` offers us a better mechanism for error handling and flow control guarantees.

You can learn more about pull-streams at:

- [pull-streams documentation](https://pull-stream.github.io/)

#### Converting `pull-streams` to Node.js Streams

If you are a Node.js streams user, you can convert a pull-stream to a Node.js stream using the module [`pull-stream-to-stream`](https://github.com/pull-stream/pull-stream-to-stream), giving you an instance of a Node.js stream that is linked to the pull-stream. For example:

```js
const pullToStream = require('pull-stream-to-stream')

const nodeStreamInstance = pullToStream(pullStreamInstance)
// nodeStreamInstance is an instance of a Node.js Stream
```
