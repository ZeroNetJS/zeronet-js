### This module uses `pull-streams`

We expose a streaming interface based on `pull-streams`, rather then on the Node.js core streams implementation (aka Node.js streams). `pull-streams` offers us a better mechanism for error handling and flow control guarantees.

You can learn more about pull-streams at:

- [pull-streams documentation](https://pull-stream.github.io/)

#### Converting `pull-streams` to Node.js Streams

If you are a Node.js streams user, you can convert a pull-stream to a Node.js stream using the module [`pull-stream-to-stream`](https://github.com/pull-stream/pull-stream-to-stream), giving you an instance of a Node.js stream that is linked to the pull-stream. For example:

```js
const pullToStream = require('pull-stream-to-stream')

const nodeStreamInstance = pullToStream(pullStreamInstance)
// nodeStreamInstance is an instance of a Node.js Stream
```
